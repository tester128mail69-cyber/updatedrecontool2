## Code Style Guidelines

- **Python 3.10+** — use modern Python features (match/case, `|` unions, etc.)
- **Type hints** — all public functions must have type hints
- **Docstrings** — use Google-style docstrings
- **Line length** — 100 characters max
- **Async-first** — all I/O operations must be async
- **Error handling** — never let a module crash the entire scan; catch exceptions and log them

## Adding a New Scanner Module

1. Create a directory under `godrecon/modules/your_module/`
2. Create `__init__.py` and `scanner.py`
3. Inherit from `BaseModule`:

```python
from godrecon.modules.base import BaseModule, ModuleResult

class YourScanner(BaseModule):
    name = "your_module"
    description = "What this module does"

    async def _execute(self, target: str, **kwargs) -> ModuleResult:
        findings = []
        # ... your logic here ...
        return ModuleResult(findings=findings)
```

4. Register the module in `godrecon/core/engine.py`
5. Add tests in `tests/`
